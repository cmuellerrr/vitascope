    <h1>Here's how it works.</h1>
    <p>Vitascope Arts is a full service video production company that specializes in helping businesses tell the world about their products. To do that, we use a pretty simple process for getting ideas out of our collective heads and onto the screen.</p>

    <h2>Step 1 &mdash; We plan every detail</h2>
    <p>After working with you to define the concept, we write a detailed script and storyboard with things like sets and characters. If you like what you see, we start locking down locations, actors, and equipment.</p>

    <h2>Step 2 &mdash; Shoot everything in sight</h2>
    <p>Once we build a shot list, we move into full production where we'll spend anywhere from 1 to 5 days filming. We're perfectionists, so we take time to make sure we get everything we need.</p>

    <h2>Step 3 &mdash; Make it perfect</h2>
    <p>Then we get to start editing. This includes the fun stuff like color grading, sound mixing, and score composition. We'll work with you to get feedback on each draft to make sure the end product is exactly what you want.</p>

    <h2>Step 4 &mdash; Then deliver the goods</h2>
    <p>When <em>we</em> love it, and <em>you</em> love it, we'll apply the finishing touches and export the video to any formats you need so you can show it to the world and watch the customers roll in.</p>
